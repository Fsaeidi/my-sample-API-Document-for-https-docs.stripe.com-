business rules:

        1. All Stripe accounts can have balances in two states:
               pending, meaning the funds are not yet available to pay out.
               available, meaning the funds can be paid out now.
        2.every account has their own balance.
        3.a platform account can also have a connect_reserved balance, used to offset negative balances on connected accounts.
        4.connect_reserved is for connect.


Extension Point:
we can add 2 fields for filtering better:
  key,keyId
 key can be filled with card,accountNumber,userId,..
keyId is a value of key
for ex: key:userId   keyId:234
so in the result just show the amount of this user that decrease traffic,..and optimize the request because majority of people just want to know specific thing per time
but if they intend to see all source types they use current request.
