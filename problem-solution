dentified problems:
in balance API needs to determine a mandatory field in request.
if it worked with token,it would dedicat an exact property.
I mean sometime people have accsses to other`s token
and I belive should be better with a field(like:userid,accountId or email).without them we need to check lots of things 
and serve them that are not not resonable.
